WTF! Will NOT be recommending this book to anyone.\n",
            "105.1% This book contains some great illustrations.  However, the story is very unrealistic for my home.  What bothers me with this story is how passive the parents are.  They repeatedly ask Emma to clean her room which she never does.  This behavior would be considered disobedient and disrespectful in my home and would meet with a consequence enforced by the adults.  Because I don&#8217;t want my child exposed to media that says directly or indirectly it is ok to ignore adults, disobey adults or break promises, I cannot recommend this book.\n",
            "105.1% The premise of the story was interesting, and the prologue was quite promising.  A typical romance where both the heroine and hero have to overcome their traumatic past in order to learn to love again.  Fine.We see the two interacting over and over in the first few chapters, but never really spend any time together until the drive home from lunch in Chapter 7, after the five hour &#34;lunch&#34; was completely glossed over.  This is followed by many chapters of the two coming together, pushing apart, (repeat over and over and over).  The coming together nearly all physical, the pushing apart rather mean-spirited lashing out, to be honest.  I'm not sure that any man would say she was a &#34;challenge&#34; instead of just calling her a &#34;b**ch&#34;.  And he wasn't without fault, either.In other words, I just didn't see how anything was coming together for these two, and then suddenly, abrupt HEA ending at 92%!  What just...why...how did this happen?!?!?!The secondary story of Kate's tenuous job at the hospital was also interesting, but concluded weakly.  I would have liked this part of the story built up more to round out Kate's character.That's my overall impression of the story.Also, there were quite a few typos - enough to be distracting, but not annoying.  The nice, but slightly cheesy, professional-looking cover had me thinking this was a published book, but the typos were indicative of self-publishing or a very, very bad proofreader.Despite one of the one-star reviews, the sex in the book was quite mild.  In fact, the use of euphemisms made for very confusing reading and honestly, I couldn't follow the action at all.  I just didn't get it.And of course, my review wouldn't be complete without mentioning the military issue...I do not believe there are any commissioned Marine officers, especially Naval Aviators (USMC pilots are Naval Aviators), that did not attend at least two years of college.  At least in recent times - and this book mentions cell phones so we're talking at least in the 90's or 2000's.  I believe even LDO's and Warrant Officers (not pilots) have to get degrees these days.  This is not an important issue because it does not affect the timeline or anything at all, but just annoys me.I would not recommend this book.\n",

At one point, I was laughing so hard, I had to put it down until I collected my barrings.These two were perfect for each other;&#34;Oh my, why did I touch her there?&#34;&#34;Oh my, why did he touch me there?&#34;&#34;Shes not being very modest.&#34;&#34;I'm not being very modest. Maybe I should go for it. After all, he did touch me there. There's nothing wrong with that.&#34;&#34;Maybe she would like to help me prepare some taxes when we're done.&#34;LMAO!And the use of clinical wording to describe parts best left unmentioned, well that only added to the comedy of it.Really, I would not recommend this book to anyone, but if you are in the market for a good twisted laugh, you'll get it here for sure.\n",

            "88.3% I wanted to like this book, I really did. It sounded like it was right up my alley. Then I started reading. First off, I had a serious problem with Abbey agreeing to help her friend by possibly having sex with what she thought was a married man. Then she meets the guy and is attracted to him so of course she sleeps with him, again knowing he's supposedly married. She doesn't know anything about him, just takes the word of her friend who tells her he's a sleaze.  Apparently the friend is a lousy businesswoman as she doesn't even know who she's filming and has no qualms about watching and filming her friend have sex with the married man. With a friend like that, who needs enemies. Don't waste your time on this one. Even if you can deal with the above, the Billionaire turns out to be a rather namby pamby sniveling fool who, for such a savvy businessman, is sure a poor judge of character and can't seem to make up his mind about anything.\n",

            "94.6% Brought to you by OBS reviewer AndraIntriguing&#8230;suspenseful&#8230;&#8230;riveting&#8230;.a bit of romance thrown in.  All adjectives I like to use when describing a book I just finished reading.  I found the depth and complexity of the building of the bridge interesting and well written.  The archaeological aspects of the story grabbed me and would not let me go until I had read every word in the story.I loved the saying&#8230;&#8220;But he knew he was stuck between a tsunami and an avalanche.&#8221;A nice change from the saying &#8220;being stuck between a rock and a hard place&#8221;.  This phrase brought a smile to my face.  Humor is also another valuable component of a good read.I am happy to report that the shift between current time and the time when the bridge was built was smooth and not confusing to this reader.  When transitions between time periods are not smooth, I tend lose interest right away, so needless to say, I was pleasantly surprised when the transitions were smooth.Jeffrey Perren portrayed the challenges, set-backs and risks that go along with archaeological digs in a realistic and engaging manner.  At each set back I rooted for Griffin&#8230;.he just had to get the funding was all I thought!  And boy did Griffin have LOTS of setbacks.Speaking of Griffin, he is such a likeable main character. But definitely fraught with bad luck&#8230;or so it seems.  As the story continues we realize that sabotage is in the air.  But of course the mystery remains as to who would do such a thing to this academic?  I am happy to report that as with any good mystery, it was not until the very end that I put the pieces together.  The story held my interest and at times kept me reading far later than I had anticipated.Griffin&#8217;s love interest &#8211; Mari is a strong Peruvian woman with her mind made up as to what she wants to do and accomplish in her own right.  She has a domineering father who wants her to marry Miguel &#8211; to further his own aspirations (business and political).  At times it was hard to tell if she was with Griffin or against him&#8230;..but I had to believe as a woman whom loved Griffin, that she was just portrayed as sneaky (to rival her father and Miguel).This book is an excellent and captivating story.  Told with ease, from the perspective of modern day and the 9th century. This is a long read but I am glad that I persevered and completed this intriguing story.*OBS would like to thank the author for supplying a free copy of this title in exchange for an honest review*\n",
            "94.6% I recieved a copy of Cartier's Ring in exchange for an honest review.This is a well researched historical novel depicting life and conflct between various Canadian Indian tribes, and their trade and transactions with the early French explorers and traders in the 16th century.The first part of the novel tells the story of Myeerah, a young girl who is a &#8216;foreigner&#8217; in her tribe, and whose &#8216;husband&#8217; is taken to France, and never seen by her again, while she is kidnapped by her birth tribe. The second part, continues with Myeerah's story jumping forward in long strides, until she is finally seen as an octogenarian grandmother.I found the different names of tribes and people, very confusing. I thought too many characters were mentioned. Also, I didn&#8217;t feel I got to know any of them very well. Another confusing aspect was the constant change in narrator, which was first person for some characters and third person for others. The action chops and changes quickly between tribes, and to the French ship, and crew. Ultimately, there was too much information packed into too few pages. A brief introduction with a map and some basic historical information would have been helpful.I think someone who is interested in Canadian history might be drawn into the story, but I found it very hard to relate to the characters and follow the story line.\n",
            "94.6% **I RECEIVED THIS NOVEL IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST REVIEW**Where to begin?The book begins with Clare Murray, Logan Matthews and Clare's daughter, Maddie, are flying into a destination wedding resort to get married. After a few snafus, the couple get married. There really isn't much more to say about the plot of the book. It basically follows the couple around over the few days leading up to and their wedding day.It had a few sweet moments... like Logan singing a song to Clare and Maddie asking if she could call Logan Daddy, but I felt those were the highlights of the book.Honestly, Clare came off as very neurotic throughout the book. Everything was 'a sign' that they shouldn't get married... her dress being ruined when they landed at the resort when she hated it to begin with, Logan's fainting by the pool. It just aggravated me a little bit that she was reading too much into all these events. Airlines are NOTORIOUS for losing/ruining luggage ALL the time. If you don't eat something during the day and are in the sun, yes, you will faint.The sex scenes were mediocre. That MIGHT be my fault, though... I read a LOT of BSDM/erotic books, so I am accustomed to NOTHING being left to the imagination. If you like your books to just brush along the edge of erotic scenes, Ms. Berg's portrayal will be right up your alley. But it just didn't do anything for me.This book also included a bonus short story, Never Been More Ready, which focuses on Clare's BFF, Leah and her husband Declan. I wouldn't say it followed the couple as they prepared for parenthood, since it mainly centered around the night Leah went into labor (and all the hilarity of the beginning of labor), but it was enjoyable. I found it to be TOO short. I would have liked more about the baby's first year, like her first word and first steps.FINAL THOUGHTSFun read. Easily readable in a day, if not less depending on your reading speed. Just don't expect it to be gritty and dirty.STARS: 4/5WOULD RECOMMEND: Yes\n",
            "94.6% I was given a copy of &#34;Wilde and the Witch&#34; by Lisagh J. Winters in exchange for an honest review.  Also I'm participating in the virtual book tour hosted by Star Angel's Review.*****Olivia Emerson is a young clairvoyant that has been investigating haunting for a few years now. Only problem is that she's been doing it on a volunteer basis.  Not getting anywhere financially, she has been supporting herself waiting tables in hopes that she will one day hit it big in the world of  ghost hunting.She seizes the opportunity, cleans almost all her savings out in order to work with the famous Sullivan Wilde.  They have been called to Newfoundland to investigate a haunting in Port Aux Basque.  All they know is that there is some evil and dark entity that is haunting a small private island and the owner needs this ghost gone before he loses everything he has invested.With Sullivan Wilde, he has a chip on his shoulder.  He doesn't believe that people can talk to ghosts.  He has refused to work with any sort of clairvoyant due to them all being charlatans.  However, this time he doesn't have a choice.  The client has demanded to have the best clairvoyant on this case irregardless of how Sullivan feels.From the first meeting, Olivia and Sullivan start to butt heads.  He has an arrogant attitude about him.  She doesn't trust men.  So the two of them are destined nothing but trouble.  Olivia is trying her best to get along with Sullivan, but with his stubbornness, sharp tongue, and ill temper, she has to learn to stand her ground to this beautiful man.Sullivan has issues from the first time he laid eyes on Olivia.  First, she appears to be really young.  He swore she looked 15.  Secondly, she is the most beautiful looking thing he ever saw.  However, it's her capabilities as a psychic medium that make him detest her even more.  Plus, this woman has sas. She isn't taking his crap that he's dishing out...she's slinging it right back in his face...very attractive!It's when they get to the remote island and dropped off in the dead of a winter blizzard, do the two discover that what they are about to face is pure evil.  They will have to either learn to set their differences aside and work together or someone will get hurt.  With a ghost that is pure evil, capable of physically harming humans, the extreme cold temperatures and ego's getting in the way, will this highly dysfunctional pair be able to survive what is ahead of them?*****I don't understand why I do this to myself, but I love to read paranormal book but will refuse to watch a scary movie.  With this book, it scared the crap out of me!  I made the mistake of reading it at night.  I did fine until they hit the island.  Granted this book is mild in comparison to some of the horror novels I read, I still got scared.  I had nightmares galore and wasn't able to go back to sleep.I did find myself getting irritated with how Sullivan was acting.  I just wanted to reach up and slap him for his behavior towards Olivia.  With his constant insults and not believing in what she was capable of doing, I so hated him.  I can see how she was attracted to this beautiful man, but sometimes it's the attitude that makes them ugly.There was a couple of issues I had with the book.  One was how the story jumped so fast towards the end.  Not to give away the ending, but it was like the story just hit a wall and stopped in regards to the evil ghost.  Also, I realize that there is some issues with Sullivan that Olivia and I both were questioning, but I am only assuming that these will be addressed in the second installment, &#34;His Wounded Rose,&#34; which I'm starting ASAP.Other than these two minor glitches, I did enjoy this book.  It does have enough horror aspect to it to scare me.  Plus enough romance to please any romance fan.  My only suggestion is, if you do get spooked slightly, then this might not be good night-time reading!\n",
            "94.6% Vampire Keller O'Leary has only stepped foot in Nashville for two reasons:1). His sister, Sage, sent him a personal invitation;2). There is powerful blood flowing through the veins in Nashville.Only, there's a female force to be reckoned with inside this town.  After partaking in his evening &#34;meal&#34; and depositing her at the local hospital for treatment, he's assaulted.  His attacker is female, knows he is a vampire, and orders him to leave the city....Immediately.  There's just one problem:  he may have quite possibly located his one and only true mate.  Okay ~ actually there are a couple of problems ~ The second being the identity of his true mate.This is a well written novella that pulled  me into the world of Josie Hawk and won't let go.  I immediately added Crimson Beat and Indigo Dawn to my TBR shelf on Goodreads (see links below to add them to yours!)  Josie is a Huntress and she has no problem exerting her badassery.  She's intolerant of evil and bends over backwards (forward, inside, outside, or upside down if need be) to protect her humans.There is a certain amount of undeniable chemistry between Keller and his mate.  When Keller actually realizes what (or who) he's finally found, his lost sense of humanity slowly starts to rebuilt itself.  Josie is a tough, sarcastic hero but her love for the human population of Nashville is undeniable, making her a very strong and likable character.  Part of the novella is told from Keller's POV and part is told from Josie's POV.  This gives the novella a uniqueness that allows both characters to shine without dimming the star power of the other.  I can't wait to see where the author takes us in the next novella and full-length novel.Review copy courtesy of the author/publisher, at no cost, in exchange for an honest review.\n",

            "91.6% Even though I've never really considered myself a romance fan, K.J. Charles is rapidly becoming one of my favorite authors - enough that, when I finished burning through A Case of Possession and saw there weren't to be any further Magpie Lord books for several months but this one was coming out in a couple of weeks, I did something I've never done before and pre-ordered it!  Something about her stories manages to fascinate and inspire me in a way that few romances (and, really, few stories) do.Upon reflection, I think it's the care and focus with which she builds her characters.  It seems like a lot of romance stories take a significant shortcut in that arena, just assuming that these are nice people that you like and want to see together, without taking any time to demonstrate who they really are, or why they're attracted to each other, or any of the historical or emotional context other than perhaps a few casual swipes at a past affair gone wrong or an unhappy childhood.  Charles' characters, on the contrary, are vividly drawn, with well-developed histories, personalities, and motivations, and thus real chemistry.  (I particularly liked the contrast here between Curtis' straightforward-to-a-fault worldview and da Silva's demimonde of entendres and subtle implications.)  I also love that her romances always contain an external story of some sort - relationships are shaped by context as much as by individuals, and hers never exist in a vacuum.The writing is still a little tell-don't-show in places, and the transitions between the character moments and the external plot can be a touch choppy. Still, Charles' style continues to improve, and the ending is left open for potential sequels that I feel the characters could well support.  I'm very much looking forward to her next book, be it about these characters, the Magpie series characters, or some other series entirely.\n",

So I'm starting from the beginning and enjoying the series all over again. While I remember some,  there was still a bunch I'd forgotten in this first book.In my family a pair of siblings married a pair of siblings so it's definitely a concept I am very familiar with. When I was a little girl it never occurred to me that one set of those couples could be one brother from each respective family. Which is the case with Travis' family. There are no gay family members. To the point that he is deeply closeted.  Living a lie to placate his homophobic parents.  He hoped he had his sister's support but he can't be certain so he doesn't want to risk loosing her love & respect. When two wolf shifter brothers scent them as mates, there are double dates where Travis and his Mate are actting as &#34;chaperones&#34;. Of course the mate pull is too strong and Rainy's seduction too enticing for Travis to resist. As you can imagine this causes alot of problems within his family. And if that's not enough there is the little matter of their mates revealing to Travis and his sister that they're wolf shifters. Screams and locked doors! Then there is the little issue of someone else claiming Rainy as a mate. Oh really?!!But to answer the main question A shifter ends up in the zoo when there are poachers in the National Forest who tranq him & others then sell them to zoos. Cliff Travis' brother in law helps bring awareness to the other animals and shifters in need who are also being victimized by the poachers. He lets his pack alpha know who brings in a Siberian tiger shifter who's a police detective, in addition to other pack members the beta and enforcer. The scene is set for the next book in the series.\n",

I enjoyed the beginning but I quickly found myself losing interest and skimming pages. It wasn't the dark factor or the taboo subject matter those I can deal with and read often. It just seemed to fall off somewhere. Some of the character interaction seemed odd, the conversations were off. It became very chopping not finishing a thought or a scene completely. Then the ending seemed very rushed.I have read other work by Missy Johnson and this definitely didn't have the same feel or writing style.

As a mom of two elementary school students, as a business owner and entrepreneur, the tools in this concise, highly-enjoyable book gave me valuable insights for better utilizing my resources to nurture a culture of prosperity in running my days. A novice at understanding the principles of Feng Shui, I found this book to be well-written in terms of giving educating me on the five elements of Feng Shui and I was initially intrigued by this title because marrying what I knew of Feng Shui with wealth seemed a strange marriage to strike. But this book didn&#8217;t disappoint in any way.The author&#8217;s style is informative without being too technical, as well as engaging and attention-grabbing. Clear learning objectives are identified, so you know exactly what you&#8217;ll learn by reading this book! For the value this book brings in giving much food for thought to all those inclined to succeed and for teaching me several excellent techniques I can immediately implement at home as a mom and in my business, I highly recommend this book.\n",

            "202.3% Citizen Dead (The Harvest #1) by Kevin Anthony is a zombie horror short story about Roam, a twenty-something man who becomes one of the living dead.Roam chokes one morning on his breakfast. Desperate for air, he drinks contaminated tap water. The worldwide pollution raises the dead and makes them zombies. Roam does what any recently dead young man who wakes up in the morgue would do. Our hero calls his best friend Slade, and then goes to work in a department store.Although never turning into a farce, Citizen Dead (The Harvest #1) uses a light touch to describe the first day in the life of a dead man. Roam&#8217;s matter-of-fact explanation of why the media faked his death (which it did not&#8212;Roam had died) lent a refreshing mature point of view to the story&#8217;s hero. The complications of dealing with a zombie that claimed his apartment, and the hometown residents struggling with the living dead infestation, make for an interesting read.A tip of the hat goes to Kevin Anthony for building a zombie fantasy world that avoids the &#8220;we eat brains&#8221; horror clich&eacute;s. The story does a good job introducing characters with distinct voices, and I was especially pleased to find some people using the zombie menace to fuel their greed and revenge.

WAS NOT HAPPENING!This book captured my interest from the very beginning and by the end, owned a huge piece of my heart. It's about so many different emotions being felt at the same time. It's nothing like the \"stereotypical\" contemporary romance...it has it's own way of luring you into these characters and wanting to be a part of it. I truly couldn't put the book down and had to literally force my eyes opened til it was too late....then morning came and I finished it!Ms. Pelton created such a strong character development that you were in no way feeling absent of each of their storylines. In this book you get multiple POV's that help guide you through the story to enhance it all the more. I know lately different POV's have been a huge success and I, myself adore them but she doesn't give you just 2...she fits them into the novel perfectly to once again guide you through this amazing story without confusion.The 2 main characters are strong and endearing. They are a force to be reckon with and make for a 5 star review.Thank You Ms.Pelton..I look forward to reading all her novels from past to future and wish nothing but success in her career. If this book is any indication, we will see much more of her.\n",

Allie is a sex therapist, who also teaches women how to find their confidence and inner voice. Cameron is a classic car restorer. Both have come back to Shelbyville after leaving after high school. Allie has opened up her business, and Cameron has just bought a garage for his.Allie was the town princess back in the day; her Dad runs the bank, so he basically runs the town. Cameron was a jock who had to pick up the slack after his Dad left his Mom. Cameron always thought Allie was out of his league. He runs into her on his first day to his new garage when she hits his beloved car, BB, with her big, shiny escalade. Sparks and interest are definitely there when he approaches her about the damage to his car.Allie gets confronted from the women she helps in her group therapy class about why she doesn't have a man in her life. She decides she better get some more experience of her own, to show the women what she teaches them does work. In a small town population, there aren't many men who she would want to help bring out her inner bad girl. Since Cameron is back in town, since he is very easy on the eyes, and since she knows that he is interested in her, Allie propositions him with a no strings attached fling. Cameron is shocked, but since he does have an interest in her, he accepts the offer. He learns more about Allie, and starts to think about other things than just sex.Allie's father does not approve of her business. He would like nothing better than to see it fail. He does one last thing that could be the end of Allie's job.

            "90.8% I was given this book free through LibraryThing Member Giveaways in exchange for an honest review.This story can fit into a myriad of genres, such as Horror, fantasy/Sci-Fi, YA, Supernatural thriller etc. The premise is original, where a secret military squad, answering directly to the President, is responsible for solving crimes in the here and now, by conversing with the dead. The way this is done, is by using a combination of terminally ill military personnel, and sending them on a final mission into the afterlife, in search of people who died with important information, and having them relay that information to the resident seer (A gambling Gypsy who converses with the dead through a crystal door knob), before entering the final stage of their respective afterlife.The main arc in The Terminals: Spark, is the relentless, bloody search for a serial killer who died without revealing where he had hidden a busload of kidnapped children. Hillar the Killer, the serial killer in question, was also a Gnostic, and in order to find him, the \"Terminal\" or Euth being sent, must also be a Gnostic, or at least be an expert in Gnostic afterlife beliefs. An interesting storyline to be sure, but also extremely dark, and not for the weak of heart, especially those upset by stories of kidnapped children being tortured and killed.Michael F.Stewart combines sobering violence, with ironic psychological commentary dealing with suicide, murder, government secrecy, spiritualism and morality. The language is colorful, and at times is downright amusing, such the sentence \"the general's office stank like someone had left a used colostomy bag on a radiator to cook.\"  This is not a feel-good, happy ending type of book, but if you like your horror-thrillers dark, quick paced and thought-provoking, I would highly suggest jumping on board for the ride.The last page of the epilogue will straighten your spine, and if you are like me, will make you yearn for volume 2 of the Terminals series.Read review on my blog the Thugbrarian review @ [...]\n",

But she's been working on transforming herself, outside and in, and now that she's lost all but the last five pounds, she feels ALMOST ready to enter into the competition for bedding a groomsmen at her big brother's destination wedding. AND she's had a crush on Logan McCade for a long, long time.Logan has agreed to &#34;look after&#34; his best friend's introverted little sister, although the heart-shaped, lush ass  leaning over the hotel desk in front of him is awfully tempting. Lucky for him they turn out to be the same person, although banging her practically cross-eyed was probably not what big bro Colton had in mind. So there's the added spice here of secret, forbidden love.I received an ARC courtesy of Entangled Publishing in exchange for an honest review.Sophie does border on annoyingly insecure, and Logan's workaholic ways would leave most women questioning whether they were being played, but of course, it all works out for a Happily Ever After in the end.Lots of steamy sex in these 150 or so pages, and plenty of laugh out loud humor. When Sophie arranges herself, seductive-like, on the bed, and goes to turn out the light... I almost wet myself laughing. Really a delightful read.\n",
            "90.8% Typically, when it comes to romance heroines, I am generally not a fan. You can say that I am all about the men in the romance genre. Mrs. Gibb changed my mind. Marlo is the type of woman who masquerades as if she has everything under control, when in fact she is a broken woman. The thing that the author did right in this book is not to pretend as if Marlo is stronger than she appears. We, the reader, can see that there's something gone awry in Marlo's past. We just don't know what it is.Now to my favorite part of the story, the man. The thing I like most about Adam is the fact that he is not your typical hero. It seems that the romance genre is saturated with overly masculine men, the type that are so strong, so domineering that they drown out their female counterparts. Adam is a reasonable man. He is the type of man that you could meet on the street and not want to instantly punch in the face, which seems to be a thing in romance. However, his ability to be reasonable does not distract from his ability to be masculine. I have no doubt whatsoever that Adam is an alpha male, he just isn't the type of alpha that is only good on paper, but not entirely practical in real life. While I understand fiction is primarily for escapism, I do like the fact that Adam is more representative of real men in the fact that his masculinity does not squeeze out Marlo's existence.The story of Marlo and Adam's romance is a sweet one made complicated by Marlo's tragic past. Things are not made any less complicated by Adam's past, but Marlo is the one who is most reluctant to change.  Overall I like this story. It was sweet, the sex came at the right time and had the right amount of sizzle. Gibb made sure that there was more story than sex. If you are looking for a romance, this is it.**This novel was given as a gift in exchange for an honest review.**\n",

            "63.5% If you've read the other books in the series, your well aware of who Shane is. You'd know how his loss affected Reid and Dylan. What we don't know is Shane's side. Part 1 of this book is full of Shane's life, of why he did the unthinkable, and what part Dylan played in it all. This is the part that helps us to understand why Dylan felt responsible for his death. I'll not lie, by the time Part 1 was done I wanted to hate Dylan. I just couldn't though. He has tortured himself enough over his choices and it's caused enough grief and remorse. This part of the book is full of denying and then accepting their homosexuality and how those around them would perceive them because of it. It also shows the abuse that both Reid and Shane suffered from their father both physically and mentally. Be prepared to shed some tears. It's hard to take in how cruel people can be just because of who someone loves.In Part 2, Dylan meets Conner. Conner has been through an emotional 2 years to say the least, but unlike Dylan he didn't let it keep him down. He rose from it choosing to take the better road. When the two meet the attraction is undeniable. However, Dylan meets his match in Connor. I loved the fact that Connor put down the date rule. This book expressed a homosexual couple without the stereotypes. It approached every detail just as if they were any other couple, yet also showed the awkwardness of how society assumes things of them. As with the other books in the series, Connor and Dylan go through some tough moments and circumstances.Part 3 is full of trying to become happy as both want to be. I love the ending! It's so appropriate and gives just enough of a glimpse of what's to come. The whole clan is there and we see a glimpse into each relationship from the series.This book as a whole is probably the best of all. It's a difficult topic to write about. Melissa Collins nailed it, it's full of emotion that will leave you raw and thoughtful during each part. It will make you want to hold the young around you and let them know how much you appreciate them. It will make you want to sit and talk to make sure your loved ones aren't experiencing problems. It may make you feel ashamed of words that have left your mouth and careful they don't leave your mouth again. It shows just how powerful words in frustration or anger are and how they can affect those we love.This book is a definite 5 star thought provoking read.You'll laugh, cry, smile, and blush throughout each part of the book.\n",

I need not have worried.The author is skilled in transporting her reader to the Dolomites, and the smells, sounds and textures of that part of the world permeate the novel. The descriptions are detailed and sensuous without being overdone. The characters and plot are well-marshalled and the love interest grows organically in the story.I will certainly be reading other books in this series.\n",

We are also given information about Jane's background, that isn't as pretty as we may have thought.  She decides to leave her abusive boyfriend and move back home to sort her life out.  She isn't looking for love, but it finds her when she meets Cal.I absolutely loved this book!  The best things happen to you when you aren't expecting or looking for them... which is exactly what happens with Jane and Cal.  Once Cal sets his sights on Jane, there's no holding back.  Neither one was looking for a serious relationship, but once fate steps in, there's no stopping it.  Their attraction is immediate, as if their souls were made for each other.  They are that couple that you could picture being together forever and make you believe in soul mates.  Cal is the guy you want piecing together your broken heart, if you ever find yourself in that situation.This book is a novella that ends in a cliffhanger.  Don't let that stop you from picking it up.  There is so much emotion packed into this book, that you'll forget it's a short read (until you get to the last page and wish there was more).  This book is written so beautifully that you can feel the love between Cal & Jane.  She had me right from the Prologue.  I do need to add that the last line in the book.... if you were to google 'the right way to do a cliffhanger in a book', THAT line should be there.  Holy Cow!!!  Go big or go home!

He thought he was doing the right thing, he was a kid himself when he got out & he had no idea the horrific life Claire lived while he was building his hockey career. Then we have dancer Reese Allen, who seems so cold and aloof, but she's really broken after finding out the love of her life crushed her young heart and dreams, prompting her to leave her blossoming dance career in NY to return home to Nashville and open her dance studio. Reese and Phillip are off limits to each other, but after a ONS, can't get enough of the other. I love their friendship and the banter between them. Phillip is such a wonderful guy but so terrified Reese will bolt if he confesses he wants more with her. I really enjoyed the relationship between Reese, Phillip and Claire, how they came together as a family. Yeah, I'm a huge Assassins fan!\n",
